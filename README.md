Photon Laser Tag game interface

Installation: Download repository code as zip folder, or clone using the link: "https://github.com/StevenVickers/LaserTag.git". Next, compile and run the Java project. Then, click the "Edit Players" button, and fill in the player ID's and codenames. Finally, click the "Start Game" button to start the game.

Running the Traffic Generator: Once the game is running and the "Start Game" button is pressed the timer will count down from 5 and a new window is opened. Once the new window is open you can open the "python_trafficgenarator.py" provided in the files. Type in the PlayerID's corresponding to the PlayerID's you put in during the "Edit Players" process of the Player Entry screen. Then when prompted, type how many events(player1 hit player2) should take place during the course of the game.

Once done properly you should see the codenames of the PlayerID's you input show up in the Player Feed and points begin to total.
